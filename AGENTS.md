# Repository-level Agent Guide — Spectre

Reply in the same language as the user.

This is **Spectre**, a fork of [Kimi Code](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-code) with native SDD support. The SDD workflow and orchestration rules live in `packages/agent-core/src/profile/default/system.md`, `sdd/README.md`, and `sdd/workflow.md`. This file contains only repository-specific rules for working on Spectre itself.

## 1. Working principles

- Think from first principles. Start from real requirements, code facts, and verification results; if the goal is unclear, discuss it with the user first.
- Treat code, not documentation, as the source of truth. Unless the user explicitly says otherwise, do not read ordinary Markdown just to understand the implementation.
- Before making code changes, read the relevant code and the most recent constraints, and follow the nearest `AGENTS.md` in the directory tree.
- Keep changes focused. Do not slip in unrelated refactors along the way.
- When committing, do not add any co-author attribution, and do not reveal the identity of the agent in commit messages, PR descriptions, or any explanatory text.

### Monorepo layout

- `apps/kimi-code`: the CLI / TUI application. It consumes core capabilities through `@moonshot-ai/kimi-code-sdk` and must not depend directly on `@moonshot-ai/agent-core`. When writing or modifying its terminal UI, use the `write-tui` skill (`.agents/skills/write-tui/SKILL.md`).
- `apps/kimi-web`: the browser web UI, a peer to the TUI. Vue 3 + Vite + vue-i18n; talks to the server over REST + WebSocket under `/api/v1`. It must not depend directly on `@moonshot-ai/agent-core`.
- `apps/vis`, `apps/vis/server`, `apps/vis/web`: visual debugging tools for sessions and replays.
- `packages/agent-core`: the unified agent engine, including Agent, Session, profile, skills, tools, plan, permission, background, records, the in-process DI service layer (`src/services/`), and other core capabilities. **The SDD profiles live here.**
- `packages/node-sdk`: the public TypeScript SDK and harness.
- `packages/kosong`: the LLM / provider abstraction layer.
- `packages/kaos`: the execution environment and file/process abstractions.
- `packages/oauth`: Kimi OAuth and managed auth utilities.
- `packages/telemetry`: shared client-side telemetry infrastructure.
- `packages/server`: the Kimi Code server. Hosts `agent-core` sessions and exposes them over REST + WebSocket (`/api/v1`).
- `packages/server-e2e`: live e2e tests and scenarios against a running server.

## 3. Environment requirements

- **Node.js**: `>=24.15.0` (from the root `package.json` `engines`; `.nvmrc` is `24.15.0`).
- **pnpm**: `10.33.0` (from the root `package.json` `packageManager`).
- `pnpm install` will fail when the Node version is not satisfied, because `.npmrc` sets `engine-strict=true`.

## 4. Monorepo workspace maintenance

- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` is the source of truth for workspace membership, but `flake.nix` also contains **hardcoded** `workspacePaths` and `workspaceNames` lists.
- **Whenever you add or remove a workspace package, you MUST update both `pnpm-workspace.yaml` and `flake.nix` — for every package, including leaf / test / e2e packages that nothing depends on.**
  - `pnpm-workspace.yaml` uses globs (`packages/*`, `apps/*`), so most packages land there automatically; `flake.nix` is fully manual and is where omissions happen.
  - Missing a path in `flake.nix`'s `workspacePaths` will silently drop files from the Nix build's `src` fileset.
  - Missing a name in `flake.nix`'s `workspaceNames` will break `pnpmConfigHook` because dependencies for that workspace will not be fetched.
- The automated "Check flake.nix workspace sync" (`scripts/check-nix-workspace.mjs`) only validates the transitive dependency **closure of `@moonshot-ai/kimi-code`**. A leaf package outside that closure slips through even when it is missing from `flake.nix`. A green check is therefore NOT proof that `flake.nix` is fully in sync — keep it updated by hand on every add/remove.

## 5. General coding rules

- For optional object properties, pass `undefined` directly instead of using conditional spread.
  - YES: `{ user }`
  - NO: `{ ...(user ? { user } : undefined) }`
- Optional object properties do not need to additionally allow `undefined` in the type.
  - YES: `interface Options { user?: User }`
  - NO: `interface Options { user?: User | undefined }`
- Internal methods with only a single parameter should not be turned into options objects just for stylistic uniformity.
- Except for a package's `index.ts`, other `index.ts` files should prefer `export * from './module';`.
- The `Agent` class in `packages/agent-core/src/agent` must be usable on its own. The constructor must not force the caller to create a `Session` instance, nor require an `agentId` or `session`.
- Do not add too many new test files. Prefer adding tests to the existing test file of the corresponding component or module.
- When a test fails because of a user modification, default to fixing the test first; do not change the implementation to satisfy an old test unless the implementation truly has a bug.
- Do not sacrifice code quality for external compatibility unless the user explicitly asks for it. Breaking changes go through changesets and a `major` bump, gated by the rule below.
- Prefer importing via `import ... from '#/...'`, which serves the same purpose as `import ... from '@/...'`.

## 6. Experimental features

- Gate a not-yet-public feature behind an experimental flag. Add the flag to the registry at `packages/agent-core/src/flags/registry.ts`, then check it with `flags.enabled('my-feature')`. Flags are env-driven and default off: `KIMI_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_<NAME>` toggles one, `KIMI_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_FLAG` enables all. Release by flipping the entry's `default` to `true`.

## 7. Where to update instructions

- Hard rules that affect almost every task: update the root `AGENTS.md`.
- Rules that only affect a specific directory: update the nearest sub-directory `AGENTS.md`.
- Keep instruction updates focused and supported by code facts.
- When creating a PR, the PR title must follow Conventional Commit style, e.g. `chore: remove legacy format commands`.
- When an AI agent opens or updates a PR, fill in `.github/pull_request_template.md` — link the related issue or explain the problem, then describe what changed. Do not leave placeholder text or submit a generic summary of the diff.
- Do not submit vague AI-generated PR text. The human author must understand the change well enough to explain the code, edge cases, and why the approach fits this repository.
- After finishing a task and before submitting a PR, run the `gen-changesets` skill (see `.agents/skills/gen-changesets/SKILL.md`) and generate a changeset under `.changeset/` according to its rules.
- When generating a changeset, **never** decide on a `major` bump on your own. When you judge a change to meet the major criteria (breaking changes, incompatible user configuration, renamed or removed commands/arguments, changed behavior semantics, etc.), stop and explain it to the user and ask for confirmation. **Only write `major` after the user has explicitly agreed.** Otherwise default to `minor` (and fall back to `patch` if `minor` is unclear).
